# Airflow Introduction

## <span style="color:#ffbd40"> Introduction to Apache Airflow <span>

- Apache airflow is an open source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch oriented workflows.
- A web interface is available to monitor the state of the workflows.
- Airflow is scalable it can work from a laptop to distributed large system.
- It uses a <span style="color:#f57373">**workflow as a code**<span> approch.
- This helps air flow to be <span style="color:#f57373">**Dynamic**<span>, <span style="color:#f57373">**Extensible**<span> and <span style="color:#f57373">**Flexible**<span>(Workflow parameterization is built using *jinja*)
- A <span style="color:#f57373">**DAG**<span> is Airflowâ€™s representation of a *workflow*.
- \>> Between the tasks defines a dependency and controls in which order the tasks will be executed.

### <span style="color:#ffbd40">Advantages of using Airflow<span>

- Workflows can be stored in version control so that you can roll back to previous versions
- Workflows can be developed by multiple people simultaneously
- Tests can be written to validate functionality
- Components are extensible and you can build on a wide collection of existing components

### <span style="color:#ffbd40">Why not Airflow<span>

- Airflow is not a streaming solution.
- It uses coding to do the workflows.  

### <span style="color:#ffbd40">Installation<span>

Installation in windows can be tricky. We can either use Windows Subsytem for Linux or docker image to install airflow.
- [WSL2 installation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-wsl2-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-windows-10/)
    After installing the dependencies use ```console
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    ``` to install ubuntu in cmd.
