    "\n",
    "- Apache airflow is an open source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch oriented workflows.\n",
    "- A web interface is available to monitor the state of the workflows.\n",
    "- Airflow is scalable it can work from a laptop to distributed large system.\n",
    "- It uses a <span style=\"color:#f57373\">**workflow as a code**<span> approch.\n",
    "- This helps air flow to be <span style=\"color:#f57373\">**Dynamic**<span>, <span style=\"color:#f57373\">**Extensible**<span> and <span style=\"color:#f57373\">**Flexible**<span>(Workflow parameterization is built using *jinja*)\n",
    "- A <span style=\"color:#f57373\">**DAG**<span> is Airflowâ€™s representation of a *workflow*.\n",
    "- \\>> Between the tasks defines a dependency and controls in which order the tasks will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffbd40\">Advantages of using Airflow<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Workflows can be stored in version control so that you can roll back to previous versions\n",
    "- Workflows can be developed by multiple people simultaneously\n",
    "- Tests can be written to validate functionality\n",
    "- Components are extensible and you can build on a wide collection of existing components\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffbd40\">Why not Airflow<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Airflow is not a streaming solution.\n",
    "- It uses coding to do the workflows.  \n",
